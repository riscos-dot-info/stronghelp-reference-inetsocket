# This file is included from elsewhere
This call polls a specified groups of sockets to see which are ready for reading, which are ready for writing and which had exceptional conditions pending. Exceptions, with TCP, imply OOB data arrival.

The number of file descriptors is the number of bits in the descriptor sets which should be considered as having meaning, so if it is 9 only the first 9 bits (descriptors 0 to 8) will be considered. This call will return as soon as one or more of the sockets being tested is ready or when a timeout occurs.
