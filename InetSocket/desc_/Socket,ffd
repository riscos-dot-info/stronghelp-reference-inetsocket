# This file is included from elsewhere
This call creates a new socket of a given type and using a given protocol. The internet protocol family (<PF_INET>) is the only one supported by this module.

Note that this call will not give the socket an address, or connect it to any remote address. The socket can be given an address explicitly using the <Socket_Bind> or <bind>() call, or it will be assigned one automatically when it is first used to send data or to connect to a remote address.
