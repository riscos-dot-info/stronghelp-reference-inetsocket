# This file is included from elsewhere
This call is used to accept connections from server sockets that have been told to listen for new connections (using <Socket_Listen> or <listen>() ). A new socket will be created for each incoming connection, and this call is then used to obtain the descriptor for the next pending connection.

The address of the host which initiated the returned connection will also be returned, in the supplied address block.

If there are no connections waiting to be accepted, this call will block until a connection is available to be returned, unless the socket has been marked as non-blocking using <Socket_Ioctl> or <ioctl>(), in which case the error <EWOULDBLOCK> will be returned.
