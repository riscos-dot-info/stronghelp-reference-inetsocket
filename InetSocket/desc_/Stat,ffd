The only meaningful fields of the status structure filled in when stat() is applied to a socket are st_mode and st_blksize.

st_mode equals S_IFSOCK if the descriptor given is recognised as a socket descriptor.
st_blksize gives the preferred send buffer size to use for the protocol (or 0 if unknown) which can improve performance by reducing fragmentation.
