Common error numbers
#Parent !Root
Error codes are returned in the same manner as other SWIs, but the error code returned in the block is particular to the Internet socket SWIs. The main ones you will encounter are :
Name		Value	Meaning
#Line
<EWOULDBLOCK>	35	Operation would block
<EINPROGRESS>	36	Operation now in progress
<EALREADY>	37	Operation already in progress
<ECONNRESET>	54	Connection reset by peer
<EISCONN>	56	Socket is already connected
<ENOTCONN>	57	Socket is not connected
<ETIMEDOUT>	60	Connection timed out
<ECONNREFUSED>	61	Connection refused
