1	Socket has input waiting to be read (R2 = socket, R3 = port)
2	An 'urgent' event has occured, eg. arrival of OOB data (R2 = socket, R3 = port)
3	Socket's connection has been broken (R2 = socket, R3 = port)
4	RevARP reply (R2 = IPv4 of replying server, R3 = IPv4 of requesting server)
5	RevARP request pre Internet module configuration (R2 = mbuf chain, R3 = interface's SWI base)

Urgent events equate to those which would be flagged as 'exception' from <select>() or <Socket_Select>. For TCP, this implies the arrival of OOB data.

Events 1 to 3 are raised only for sockets who have enabled it using <Socket_Ioctl> or <ioctl>() <FIOASYNC>. The port number is only given with Internet 5.04 or later versions.
