Socket address
#Parent Socket_Creat
The format of an internet addresses block is :

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	<Address family=>AF_>
2	<Port number=>services>
4	IP address
8	Reserved (should be zero)
12	Reserved (should be zero)

Note: Port and IP address should be in network byte order - the reverse of the format used on Acorn machines.

# The generic form of an address is (in C) :
# #fCode; Wrap off
# struct sockaddr \{
#   unsigned short sa_family;    /* address family */
#   char           sa_data[14];  /* family specific data */
# \};
The internet form of an address is (in C) :
#fCode; Wrap off
struct sockaddr_in \{
  unsigned short sin_family;    /* address family (AF_INET) */
  short          sin_port;      /* port number */
  struct in_addr sin_addr;      /* internet address (sin_addr.s_addr) */
  char           sin_zero[8];   /* zero padding */
\};
