è	Added details of the internet event.
è	Spent ages trying to get the C version 'right'. I hope like hell that I've got it all right and that I've not made too many glaring mistakes. Since I've had to reorganise the SWI's side too, there are possibly errors in both now. Could you tell me if there are problems with any part of the system, for example things which make sense on the SWI side but not the C side. As a side-line you could change the main menu to deal with the C side by removing the #Parent Socket_ from the !Root file. Not all the links will work, but enough to be usable should. Oh, and the C side should be hotkeyed searchable now as well.
è	Renamed to InetSocket at Neil Bingham's suggestions; this is a much better name for it!
