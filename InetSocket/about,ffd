For comments, suggestions and submissions for these, please mail Justin Fletcher <\<gerph@innocent.com\>=>#URL mailto:gerph@innocent.com> who is currently moderating the collection. The primary location for these manuals will be <http://freenet.barnet.ac.uk/manuals/=>#URL http://freenet.barnet.ac.uk/manuals/>.

Hopefully, this manual should cover the everything that the other manuals have, as well as extra ground which is useful to authors.

#fH4:Dedication
This manual came about mostly because of the hard work put into developing the Internet stack and it's related software. There is no real need to mention all their names here - they and we know who they are. It is to them, and the authors who write freeware internet software, that I dedicate this manual.

History for InetSocket v1.04

{/}15 Nov 1997{/}

è	Added details of the internet event.
è	Spent ages trying to get the C version 'right'. I hope like hell that I've got it all right and that I've not made too many glaring mistakes. Since I've had to reorganise the SWI's side too, there are possibly errors in both now. Could you tell me if there are problems with any part of the system, for example things which make sense on the SWI side but not the C side. As a side-line you could change the main menu to deal with the C side by removing the #Parent Socket_ from the !Root file. Not all the links will work, but enough to be usable should. Oh, and the C side should be hotkeyed searchable now as well.
è	Renamed to InetSocket at Neil Bingham's suggestions; this is a much better name for it!
